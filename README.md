# CalcDeltaApp
CalcDeltaApp is a Python application developed using PySimpleGUI for real-time PCR experiments. It facilitates the quick and easy calculation of ΔCt, ΔΔCt, and Fold Change using data obtained from the Bio-Rad Optical File (.pcrd) generated by the CFX165 Manager from BIORAD, USA.

## Usage

### 1. Excel Data Preparation
1.1. Copy and paste Quantification Data from the Bio-Rad Optical File (.pcrd) into an Excel file (.xlsx).
1.2. Note that the quantification data in the .pcrd file is labeled Target, Sample, and Cq. Add a header row to the table in the Excel file from which you copied the data, with the corresponding cells labeled Gene, Group, and Ct, respectively.
1.3. The app automatically detects these labels (Gene, Group, and Ct) and extracts the corresponding values.
1.4. If negative control data is present, remove rows where Ct values are N/A.

### 2. Upload Excel File
2.1. Click the "Browse" button to select the Excel file. 
2.2. Click the "Read" button to load the data into the app.

### 3. Reference Gene & Control Group Selection
3.1. After data is loaded, choose the reference gene from the dropdown menu.
3.2. Select the control group using the "Select Control Group" dropdown.

### 4. Analysis
4.1. Click the "Analyze" button to calculate ΔCt, ΔΔCt, and Fold Change for each target gene.
4.2. Results are displayed in a table below the buttons.
4.3. Data is automatically saved to a CSV file ('result.csv') in the app's directory.

### 5. Plot Graphs
5.1. Click the "Plot Graphs" button to visualize Fold Change for each target gene.
5.2. Click the X icon in the upper right corner to close the graph window, and the next graph will appear immediately.

### 6. Exit
6.1. Click the "Exit" button or close the window to exit the application.

## Code Reference

### Requirements
- Python 3.11
- Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, PySimpleGUI, openpyxl

### Code Explanation
- app.py contains the main code for the CalcDeltaApp.
- The calculate_analysis function processes the data and performs the necessary calculations.
- Results are displayed using PySimpleGUI and saved to a CSV file ('result.csv') in the app's directory.
